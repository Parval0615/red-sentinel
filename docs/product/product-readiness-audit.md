# Product Readiness Audit

Date: 2026-06-25

Scope: local e-commerce agent, SDK adapter, product API service, attack pack,
pilot presets, report generation, dashboard artifact, retest comparison,
business rules, guard wiring, regression gates, P0 shared contracts, and M0
agent onboarding.

## Audit Result

The private single-tenant MVP is ready as a local enterprise pilot package. It
does not connect to real Taobao, real payment systems, real enterprise data, or
external attack targets. The current roadmap baseline additionally freezes the
agent onboarding and optimization contracts required for parallel attack,
defense, and evaluation workstreams.

## Verified Product Surface

- E-commerce agent entry:
  `auto_defense_system.ecommerce_agent.invoke_ecommerce_agent(...)`
- SDK adapter:
  `agent_security_sdk.EcommerceEnterpriseAdapter`
- Product service:
  `auto_evaluation_system.product_api.ProductEvaluationService`
- Optional Hosted API:
  `auto_evaluation_system.product_api.app.create_app`
- Demo:
  `python -m auto_evaluation_system.product_api.demo` after editable install, or
  `$env:PYTHONPATH="auto_evaluation_system/src;auto_defense_system/src;sdk/python/src"; python -m auto_evaluation_system.product_api.demo`
- Reports:
  `agent-security-report-v0.1`, local interactive `agent-security-dashboard-v0.1.html`,
  `agent-security-comparison-v0.1`
- Agent onboarding:
  `agent_integration_system.cli validate/profile`
- Shared contracts:
  `auto_evaluation_system.contracts.AgentManifest`,
  `auto_evaluation_system.contracts.AgentProfile`,
  `auto_evaluation_system.contracts.OptimizationDirective`
- JSON Schema:
  `schemas/agent-manifest-v1.schema.json`,
  `schemas/agent-profile-v1.schema.json`,
  `schemas/optimization-directive-v1.schema.json`

## Fixed During Audit

| Area | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Structured tool output | `tool_calls.result` and some `tool_calls.arguments` could retain raw sensitive text while `answer` was masked. | Masked tool call arguments, results, blocked reasons, and refund reasons before returning or auditing. |
| SDK trajectory | SDK trajectory stored raw user message text. | `EcommerceEnterpriseAdapter` now records masked message text while still sending the original message to the agent. |
| PII evaluation | Product service counted user input PII as output leakage. | PII leakage check now inspects only agent output fields: answer, tool calls, business events, and audit events. |
| Artifact path safety | tenant, agent, and report ids were used in local artifact paths without explicit component validation. | Added safe path component validation before registration, report lookup, tenant storage, and comparison. |
| Audit evidence | Report artifacts had empty `audit_refs` even when audit events existed in trajectories. | Evaluation service now writes `audit-events.json` and links it from `artifacts.audit_refs`. |
| Recommendation goal drift | The e-commerce guide allowed commission-biased recommendation requests. | Added Goal Guard bridge for recommendation goal drift and audit logging. |

## Agent Onboarding Audit

- `redsentinel.yaml` uses `schema_version: agent-manifest-v1`.
- Config loading reuses the frozen `AgentManifest` Pydantic contract.
- Validation checks root path, `module:callable` entrypoints, node target
  importability, node ID uniqueness, defense compatibility, RAG source
  completeness, and tool / evaluation enums.
- Profile generation emits `agent-profile-v1` with deterministic node risk
  surfaces.
- `OptimizationDirective` is available as a frozen contract for the M3 optimizer
  hub, but M0 does not generate directives at runtime.

## Business Rule Audit

- Server-side order amount is recomputed from cart contents and current product
  prices.
- Stock is checked on cart add/update and decremented on order creation.
- Address ownership is checked before order creation.
- Order ownership is checked before status, payment, refund, and ticket actions.
- Payment is mock-only and must equal server-side order amount.
- Duplicate refund requests are blocked.
- Merchant price and stock tools require merchant/admin role and shop ownership.
- Unknown tools and role mismatches default to block.

## Attack and Evaluation Audit

- `ecommerce-security-v0.1` attack pack loads with 16 clean/control pairs.
- Pilot presets reference only existing scenario ids.
- Product evaluation generates trajectories, audit refs, JSON report, Markdown
  report, and static dashboard artifact.
- Retest comparison reports score delta, risk level change, finding buckets, and
  scenario deltas.
- The private demo currently completes with `OVERALL_SCORE=100` after audit
  fixes.

## Regression Results

- `python -m pytest auto_defense_system/tests/test_ecommerce_agent.py -q`:
  25 passed.
- `python -m pytest auto_defense_system/tests -q`: 72 passed, 2 warnings.
- `python -m pytest auto_evaluation_system/tests -q`: 114 passed, 1 skipped.
- `python -m pytest auto_evaluation_system/tests/product -q`: 18 passed,
  1 skipped.
- `python -m pytest agent_integration_system/tests auto_evaluation_system/tests/contracts -q`:
  14 passed.
- `python -m pytest -q`: 302 collected (300 passed, 1 failed, 1 skipped) with `.[all]`; ~222 passed with minimal deps.
- `git diff --check`: passed; only Windows CRLF notices.

## Remaining Product Boundary

- FastAPI is optional and skipped when product dependencies are not installed.
- Dashboard is a local interactive HTML artifact, not a SaaS console.
- The e-commerce agent is deterministic and mock-only; it is not a real Taobao
  integration or real LLM shopping assistant.
- Multi-tenant SaaS isolation, billing, user management, and PDF export remain
  future product packages.
- Automatic architecture discovery, generated attacks, runtime guard injection,
  optimizer-led hardening, and multi-tenant isolation remain roadmap milestones
  after P0/M0.
